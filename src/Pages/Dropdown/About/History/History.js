            The journey of the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering
            started in a 7th February morning in 2003.. In spite of a humble
            beginning, the department, then known as Faculty of Computer
            Science, attracted the very best minds of the nation and soon
            accumulated a star studded faculty roster as well as the brightest
            of the students. The Faculty started four year B.Sc (Engg.) program
            in 2003. It is the first faculty that introduce the four year B.Sc
            (Engg.) program in Patuakhali Science and Technology University.
            Initially, the faculty started B.Sc (Engg.) program from 2003 with
            21 students. With the increasing demand of Computer Science
            graduates for the nation, PSTU increased the number of seats for
            B.Sc (Engg.) program to 60 in 2012. So far, 9 batches have completed
            their undergraduate studies and 4 batches are currently pursuing
            their degrees from the faculty . In total, the department has 18
            active teachers, 4 of whom have already earned their PhD degrees.
            Currently, 4 faculty members are on leave for pursuing their PhDs
            from different universities of the world
